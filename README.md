# LG Follow

## üìó Proposal

We are introducing technology that allows sound to follow the user, creating an environment where they can hear audio in any part of the house with LG appliances equipped with speakers.

Imagine an office worker getting ready for work in the morning, listening to music or the news through an AI speaker. During the morning routine, they might wash up in the bathroom, make coffee in the kitchen, have breakfast, choose clothes from the closet, and get dressed. For someone who moves between rooms so frequently, it's almost impossible to catch 100% of the audio output from a stationary AI speaker.

We will use a Raspberry Pi and PIR sensors to detect the user's location. The location information will be sent to a central control system, the AI speaker. For instance, if they leave the living room and enter the bedroom, the speaker in the living room will stop, and the speaker in the bedroom will automatically take over, seamlessly continuing the audio experience.

Additionally,  we provide an app that turns children's drawings into songs using generative AI. When a child draws a picture, the AI will create a song based on their artwork. With LG Follow, kids can enjoy listening to their own music as they move around the house, making each moment truly unique and magical.

Through generative AI, the drawings will be transformed into prompts, and those prompts will be turned into music.
